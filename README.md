# Uncryptool

This is an Unreal Engine plugin for exposing (to both C++ and Blueprints) cryptographic functions.

Currently it can be used for:

* AES and ChaCha20 Encrypt/Decrypt
* Hashing (SHA256, SHA512, RIPEMD160)
* "Cryptographically-secure" random numbers generation
* BigNumbers math
* Elliptic Curve Sign/Verify and Encrypt/Decrypt
* Data Encoding/Decoding (Base64, Base58Check, Hex, Bech32)

It wraps the OpenSSL library included in standard Unreal Engine distributions.
